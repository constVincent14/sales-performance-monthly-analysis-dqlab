# sales-performance-monthly-analysis-dqlab

This analysis comes from a case study created by dqlab.id site. The data used in this analysis comes from dqlab.id databases. The data contains information of sales performance on each office branch in many cities and provinces. But, for this analysis we only used the five largest province on the island of Java, Indonesia. We want to see the sales performance of those five largest province on monthly scale. I've used pandas' method such as, groupby, unstack, and resample to achieve the objective. Also, I've done some basic data manipulatio with pandas and use matplotlib to plot the result.
